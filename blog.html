        <h1 class="text-white text-lg font-bold">What is dom ? What is the perpouse of dom?</h1>
        <p class="pt-5 text-justify">In web development, DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents, representing the web page as a hierarchical tree structure of objects. The DOM allows programmers to access and manipulate the content and structure of a web page using programming languages like JavaScript.</p>

        <h1 class="text-white text-lg font-bold">How to select elements from dom?</h1>
        <p class="pt-5 text-justify">There are several ways to select elements from the DOM in JavaScript. Here are some commonly used methods: <br>
            1. getElementById: This method selects an element by its unique ID attribute. You can use this method to select a single element on the page. <br>
            2. getElementsByClassName: This method selects elements by their class name. You can use this method to select multiple elements on the page.<br>
            3. getElementsByTagName: This method selects elements by their tag name. You can use this method to select multiple elements with the same tag name on the page. <br>
            4. querySelector: This method selects the first element that matches a specified CSS selector. You can use this method to select a single element on the page. <br>
            5. querySelectorAll: This method selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector. You can use this method to select multiple elements on the page.
            <br>
            Once you have selected an element or elements from the DOM, you can manipulate them by changing their attributes, modifying their content, or adding or removing them from the page.</p>

        <h1 class="text-white text-lg font-bold">What is event bubble?</h1>
        <p class="pt-5 text-justify">Event bubbling Event bubbling is a type of DOM event propagation[1] where the event first triggers on the innermost target element, and then successively triggers on the ancestors (parents) of the target element in the same nesting hierarchy till it reaches the outermost DOM element or document object[2] (Provided the handler is initialized). It is one way that events are handled in the browser. Events are actions done by the user such as a button click, changing a field etc. Event Handlers are used to execute code when a particular kind of user interface event occurs, such as when a button has been clicked or when a webpage has completed loading.</p>

        <h1 class="text-white text-lg font-bold">What is call back function and what is the usage of call back function? </h1>
        <p class="pt-5 text-justify">A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked or called by that function at a later time. The main purpose of a callback function is to allow a function to call back or notify the caller about the completion of a task or an event.

            Callback functions are commonly used in asynchronous programming, where a task is started and then executed in the background while the main program continues to run. When the task is complete, the callback function is called with the result, allowing the main program to continue processing the result.</p>
